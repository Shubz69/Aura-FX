AURA FX - Exact Railway MySQL Connection Steps
===============================================

Based on your Railway Variables tab, use these EXACT values:

FOR MYSQL WORKBENCH:
====================
Connection Name: AURA FX Railway MySQL

HOSTNAME: tramway.proxy.rlwy.net
PORT: 49989
USERNAME: root
PASSWORD: FGcoKdqpUYWNb1nXzdGmBUACzeYDmewb
DEFAULT SCHEMA: railway

SSL SETTINGS (REQUIRED):
========================
1. Click "SSL" tab in connection dialog
2. Check "Use SSL" checkbox
3. SSL Mode: "Require" or "Preferred"
4. Leave all certificate files EMPTY

STEP-BY-STEP:
=============
1. Open MySQL Workbench
2. Click "+" to create new connection
3. Enter the values above
4. Go to "SSL" tab → Enable SSL
5. Click "Test Connection"

IF STILL GETTING "ACCESS DENIED":
=================================

OPTION 1: Check Railway IP Restrictions
----------------------------------------
1. Go to Railway MySQL service
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Look for "Network" or "Access Control" settings
4. Check if there are IP whitelist restrictions
5. Your IP might need to be added to allowed list

OPTION 2: Try Railway's Web Interface
--------------------------------------
1. In Railway dashboard, go to MySQL service
2. Look for "Database" or "Connect" tab
3. Railway might have a built-in SQL editor
4. Use that to verify the connection works

OPTION 3: Check Railway Service Logs
-------------------------------------
1. Go to MySQL service → "Logs" tab
2. Look for connection attempts from your IP
3. Check for any error messages about authentication
4. This will show if Railway is blocking your connection

OPTION 4: Verify Password Hasn't Changed
-----------------------------------------
1. In Railway Variables tab
2. Click the eye icon next to MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
3. Verify the password is exactly: FGcoKdqpUYWNb1nXzdGmBUACzeYDmewb
4. Copy it fresh (don't use old copy)
5. Paste into MySQL Workbench

OPTION 5: Try Different Connection Method
------------------------------------------
If MySQL Workbench keeps failing, try:
1. Use command line: mysql -h tramway.proxy.rlwy.net -P 49989 -u root -p
2. Or use a different MySQL client (like DBeaver, HeidiSQL)
3. Or use Railway's connection string directly if supported

OPTION 6: Check for Special Characters
---------------------------------------
Make sure the password doesn't have:
- Leading/trailing spaces
- Hidden characters
- Line breaks
- Copy the password directly from Railway (click eye icon, select all, copy)

FOR VERCEL (These are correct):
================================
MYSQL_HOST=tramway.proxy.rlwy.net
MYSQL_PORT=49989
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_PASSWORD=FGcoKdqpUYWNb1nXzdGmBUACzeYDmewb
MYSQL_DATABASE=railway
MYSQL_SSL=true

TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST:
==========================
□ Password copied directly from Railway (MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD)
□ No extra spaces in password
□ SSL enabled in MySQL Workbench
□ Hostname is exactly: tramway.proxy.rlwy.net
□ Port is exactly: 49989
□ Username is exactly: root (lowercase)
□ Default Schema is: railway
□ Railway MySQL service shows "Online" status
□ Checked Railway logs for connection errors
□ Tried revealing password again in Railway (in case it changed)

NEXT STEPS IF STILL FAILING:
=============================
1. Contact Railway support - they can check:
   - If your IP is blocked
   - If there are connection restrictions
   - If the MySQL service has any issues
   
2. Try connecting from a different network (mobile hotspot) to test if it's IP-related

3. Check Railway documentation for MySQL connection requirements
