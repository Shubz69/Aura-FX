AURA FX - Railway MySQL Authentication Fix
============================================

ERROR: "Access denied for user 'root'@'100.64.0.5' (using password: YES)"

This means the connection is working, but authentication is failing.

SOLUTION 1: Verify Password in Railway
=======================================
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your MySQL service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Find "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD" variable
5. Click the eye icon to reveal the password
6. Copy the EXACT password (no spaces, no extra characters)
7. Use this password in MySQL Workbench

IMPORTANT: Make sure you're copying the password from "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD", 
NOT from "MYSQL_PUBLIC_URL" (the URL has the password encoded/escaped)

SOLUTION 2: Use Railway's Connection String
============================================
Railway provides a connection string in MYSQL_PUBLIC_URL. Try using that format:

From your Railway variables, you have:
MYSQL_PUBLIC_URL: mysql://root:FGcoKdqpUYWNb1nXzdGmBUACzeYDmewb@tramway.proxy.rlwy.net:49989/railway

Try these connection details:
- Hostname: tramway.proxy.rlwy.net
- Port: 49989
- Username: root
- Password: FGcoKdqpUYWNb1nXzdGmBUACzeYDmewb (verify this is correct in Railway)
- Default Schema: railway

SOLUTION 3: Check for IP Restrictions
======================================
Railway might restrict connections by IP. Check:
1. Go to Railway MySQL service
2. Check "Settings" tab
3. Look for "Network" or "Access" settings
4. See if there are IP whitelist restrictions

SOLUTION 4: Try Creating a New User
====================================
If root user has restrictions, you might need to:
1. Connect via Railway's web interface (if available)
2. Create a new MySQL user with proper permissions
3. Use that user instead of root

SOLUTION 5: Use Railway CLI or Web Interface
==============================================
Railway might provide alternative connection methods:
1. Check Railway dashboard for "Connect" or "Database" tab
2. Look for a web-based SQL editor
3. Use Railway CLI if available

SOLUTION 6: Verify Password Encoding
=====================================
Sometimes passwords in connection strings are URL-encoded. Make sure:
- No %20 (spaces) in the password
- No special character encoding issues
- Password is copied exactly as shown in Railway

QUICK CHECKLIST:
================
□ Password copied from MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD (not from URL)
□ No extra spaces before/after password
□ Username is exactly "root" (lowercase)
□ Hostname is exactly "tramway.proxy.rlwy.net"
□ Port is exactly "49989"
□ SSL is enabled in MySQL Workbench
□ Default Schema is "railway"

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Double-check the password in Railway Variables tab
2. Try copying password again (sometimes copy/paste adds hidden characters)
3. If still failing, check Railway documentation for MySQL connection requirements
4. Consider using Railway's built-in database tools if available
