# FINAL FULL WEBSITE STATUS REPORT — AuraTerminal

**Generated:** 2026-04-24  
**Updated:** 2026-04-27 (Community production regression hardening pass: route loop + unread 429 + delete spam)

- Logged-in home market-data: `e2e/reports/HOME_LIVE_MARKET_DATA_REPORT.md` (`QA-RISK-HOME-LIVE-MARKET-001`)
- Community regression follow-up: `src/pages/Community.js`, `src/components/NavbarNotifications.js`, `src/services/Api.js`, `e2e/community-production-stability.spec.js`

## 1. Executive summary

- **Overall status:** `PASS with RISK/MANUAL follow-ups`
- **Total checked pages/features/flows:** `42`
- **PASS:** `35`
- **FAIL:** `0` (for latest verified baseline)
- **BLOCKED:** `0`
- **MANUAL:** `7`
- **Biggest remaining risks:**
  - Intermittent API/network instability (`net::ERR_ABORTED`, one observed `429` on `/api/subscription/status`)
  - Monolithic realtime audit still showed high latency vs strict targets; **focused** community latency/reload specs passed bounded QA (see §3 addendum); production SLO monitoring remains separate
  - Residual API abort noise and community 504 timeout risk under intermittent network conditions
  - Mathematical correctness of financial/report metrics not formally validated by automation
  - Trader Desk / Market Decoder cold-path latency and stale/fallback data risk (`QA-RISK-MARKETDATA-001`)
  - Twelve Data REST minute overuse risk under multi-surface polling bursts (`QA-RISK-TWELVEDATA-REST-SPIKE-001`, mitigating/verify); logged-in home watchlist uses the **same** snapshot poll interval (30s) — rotation is UI-only
  - Logged-in home watchlist quote-oracle and edge-case labelling (`QA-RISK-HOME-LIVE-MARKET-001`, mitigating)
  - Business-rule correctness for entitlement matrix and payment/subscription real-world transitions

## 2. Authentication / session status

- **Admin state:** PASS (`phase0.adminValid=true`)
- **Normal user state:** PASS (`phase0.userValid=true`)
- **Saved state files used:**
  - `e2e/reports/auraterminal-admin.json`
  - `e2e/reports/auraterminal-normal-user.json`
- **Authenticated routes validated:** Yes (hard-check validates authenticated route access and flow chapters)
- **Note:** Background QA failures were from earlier stale/invalid run-context auth and are superseded by later hard-check + strict messaging + community realtime verification.

## 3. Messaging status

- **admin -> user messaging:** `PASS`  
  Verified in strict messaging rerun.
- **user -> admin messaging:** `PASS`  
  Verified in strict messaging rerun.
- **admin inbox:** `PASS with RISK`  
  Product correctness verified; residual reliability risk remains for noisy API aborts and unvalidated concurrency/load.
- **user `/messages`:** `PASS`  
  Message visibility verified in strict messaging.
- **websocket / polling fallback:** `PASS_WITH_RISK`  
  Fallback delivery verified; residual abort-noise risk remains.
- **community realtime posting:** `PASS`  
  Verified 2026-04-24 (`COMM-RT-REM-001` passed).
- **community reload duplicate check:** `PASS`  
  Post visible once before reload and once after reload.
- **remaining messaging risk:**
  - Strict latency targets from the **monolithic** realtime audit may still fail even when **focused** community specs pass; treat operational latency under `QA-RISK-API-001` / monitoring as the long-term signal
  - Multi-channel community concurrency not fully verified (monolithic Part C)
  - True multi-user messaging concurrency not verified (>1 non-admin sender unavailable)
  - `/api/admin/users` abort noise remains reliability risk
  - 2026-04-27 regression follow-up requires production-auth Playwright rerun to fully close community channel-switch + unread 429 risk (`QA-RISK-COMMUNITY-ROUTE-002`)

### Messaging/community hardening addendum (2026-04-24)

- Reliability hardening applied in `AdminInbox`, `Messages`, `Community`, and `Api`:
  - stale-response sequence guards
  - abort-aware poll/load cleanup
  - bounded retry + backoff for safe GET reads only
  - send-queue serialization for burst send ordering (POST remains single-shot, no auto-retry)
- Targeted chromium run:
  - community post/reload dedupe: `PASS`
  - community rapid channel switching stale-content guard: `PASS`
- strict admin inbox burst/rapid-switch suite: `PASS_WITH_RISK`
- realtime latency/concurrency audit (`e2e/realtime-latency-concurrency.spec.js`):
  - Part A (admin/user): missing=0, duplicates=0, but median/p95 exceeded thresholds
  - Part B (community): missing=0, duplicates=0, but median/p95 exceeded thresholds and reload one-copy=false
  - Part C: two writable channels found but not fully verified (visibility timeout during concurrent posting)
  - Part D: true multi-user concurrency not verified (single validated normal-user state)
- **Bounded reconciliation (2026-04-25):** `e2e/community-reload-persistence.spec.js` and `e2e/community-latency.spec.js` both **PASS** — `reloadOneCopy=true`, `apiContainsPosted=true`, `uiCountAfterReload=1`, `zero=0`, `dup=0`, channel **general/General** after reload, community latency median/p95 **82ms / 2137ms** (verified run). **`QA-RISK-MSG-CONCURRENCY-001` = PASS/CLOSED for bounded QA.** This does not prove unlimited production load; API reliability monitoring remains separate.
- Status impact:
  - Community realtime remains passed.
  - Messaging product correctness verified and `QA-RISK-MSG-001` closed.
  - `QA-RISK-MSG-CONCURRENCY-001` closed for **bounded** concurrency/reload/latency criteria per focused specs + prior messaging overlap baseline; monolithic audit gaps (multi-channel, multi-user, strict global thresholds) remain documented risks outside that closure.

## 4. Community status

- **`/community`:** `PASS`
- **Welcome/rules acceptance:** `PASS` (rules acknowledgment flow accepted in realtime verification)
- **Writable channel used:** `General`
- **Post creation:** `PASS` (QA post created in writable non-announcement channel)
- **Reload persistence:** `PASS`
- **Duplicate prevention:** `PASS` (exactly one copy after reload)
- **Read-only channels:** Welcome/Announcements/Levels treated as non-post targets where applicable.

## 5. Public pages

- **`/`** — `PASS` (content available; flagged as potentially thin shell in earlier run; currently treated as healthy but keep manual visual confirmation)
- **`/courses`** — `PASS` (substantive content)
- **`/explore`** — `PASS` (substantive content)
- **`/contact`** — `PASS` (substantive content)
- **`/terms`** — `PASS` (substantive content)
- **`/privacy`** — `PASS` (substantive content)
- **`/login`** — `PASS` (form present and interactive)

## 6. User authenticated pages

- **`/profile`** — `MANUAL`  
  Notification behavior verified, but profile data correctness requires manual review.
- **`/subscription`** — `PASS with RISK`  
  Subscription page flow chapter passed; one observed API 429 in reliability sample.
- **`/messages`** — `PASS`  
  Bidirectional messaging verified.
- **`/reports`** — `PASS`  
  Data present; no hard fail.
- **`/reports/dna`** — `PASS`  
  Data/gating behavior observed; entitlement semantics still need business-rule manual check.
- **`/reports/live`** — `PASS`  
  Data signal present; monitor thin/loading behavior under load.
- **`/manual-metrics/dashboard`** — `PASS` (data signal present)
- **`/manual-metrics/processing`** — `MANUAL` (not explicitly re-verified in latest hard-check chapter list)
- **`/trader-deck`** — `PASS`
  - Targeted API probes returned data but with high cold latency (`market-intelligence` ~17.5s, `market-decoder` ~12.6s).
- **`/trader-deck/trade-validator/overview`** — `PASS`
- **`/aura-analysis/dashboard/overview`** — `PASS`
- **`/aura-analysis/dashboard/performance`** — `PASS`
- **`/backtesting`** — `PASS`
- **`/backtesting/sessions`** — `PASS` (thin but intentional classification)
- **`/surveillance`** — `PASS with RISK` (current feeds are event/news-centric; macro-economic indicators not yet first-class)
- **`/premium-ai`** — `MANUAL` (latest hard-check did not explicitly provide a fresh chapter line-item for this route)
- **`/community`** — `PASS with RISK` (baseline realtime pass exists, but latest latency audit shows 504/abort noise and reload one-copy inconsistency under stress)
- **`/leaderboard`** — `PASS`
- **`/journal`** — `MANUAL` (manual validation required for data correctness and interaction consistency)
- **notifications behavior** — `PASS with RISK` (`dropdownInteractive=true`, graceful handling yes, but intermittent fetch failures exist)

## 7. Admin pages

- **`/admin`** — `PASS` (authenticated route validated)
- **`/admin/inbox`** — `PASS with RISK` (strict rapid-switch product correctness passed; concurrency risk still open)
- **`/admin/inbox?user=88`** — `PASS with RISK` (same caveat)
- **`/admin/users`** — `PASS` (flow chapter passed)
- **`/settings`** — `PASS` (flow chapter passed)
- **admin users flow** — `PASS`
- **admin messaging/inbox flow** — `PASS with RISK`

## 8. Reports / data / calculation status

- **Reports hub** — data appeared: Yes; shell-only: No; widgets: present; **math correctness:** `MANUAL`
- **Reports DNA** — data appeared: Yes; shell-only: No; widgets: present; **math correctness:** `MANUAL`
- **Reports live** — data appeared: Yes; shell-only: No (earlier thin tendency noted); widgets: present; **math correctness:** `MANUAL`
- **Manual metrics dashboard** — data appeared: Yes; shell-only: No; widgets: present; **math correctness:** `MANUAL`
- **Aura-analysis dashboards** — data appeared: Yes; shell-only: No; widgets: present; **math correctness:** `MANUAL`

- **Leaderboard** — data appeared: Yes; shell-only: No; widgets: present; **ranking/business correctness:** `MANUAL`

**Important honesty note:** Automation here validates data presence/rendering and basic interactions. It **does not mathematically prove** financial/statistical correctness.

## 9. API reliability status

- **`/api/notifications`** — ok=43, fail=15 request-failed, fallback=`partial`, risk=`medium`
- **`/api/subscription/status`** — ok=64, fail=19 request-failed + 1x HTTP 429, fallback=`partial`, risk=`high`
- **`/api/aura-analysis/platform-connect`** — ok=6, fail=36 request-failed, fallback=`partial`, risk=`high`
- **`/api/reports/eligibility`** — ok=7, fail=9 request-failed, fallback=`partial`, risk=`medium`
- **`/api/me`** — ok=76, fail=14 request-failed, fallback=`partial`, risk=`medium`
- **`/api/users/88`** — ok=32, fail=16 request-failed, fallback=`partial`, risk=`medium`
- **`/api/markets/snapshot`** — ok=0, fail=0 in hard-check sample window, fallback=`n/a`, risk=`MANUAL`

### API addendum (targeted hardening pass — 2026-04-24)

- Code hardening landed for transient GET reliability and fetch pressure control in:
  - `src/services/Api.js` (dedupe + bounded retry/backoff for safe GETs)
  - `src/context/EntitlementsContext.js` (`/api/me` retry + keep last known-good state on transient failure)
  - `src/context/SubscriptionContext.js` + `src/pages/Subscription.js` (shared deduped `/api/subscription/status`)
  - `src/components/NavbarNotifications.js` (abort-aware polling + retry/backoff)
- Targeted endpoint probes after hardening returned HTTP 200 for:
  - `/api/subscription/status`, `/api/notifications`, `/api/aura-analysis/platform-connect`, `/api/reports/eligibility`, `/api/me`, `/api/users/88`, `/api/markets/snapshot`
- Twelve Data check:
  - `/api/ai/health` returned HTTP 503 overall, but `services.twelveData.status=healthy` in payload.
- Net status change:
  - Reliability risk remains open, but downgraded from outage concern to **intermittent/load risk** pending further soak validation.
- Added market data reliability risk (`QA-RISK-MARKETDATA-001`) pending freshness SLOs + manual oracle checks for formula/correctness.

## 10. Thin-shell / loading status

Current classification (from latest hard-check thin-shell findings):

- **`/`** — `PASS` (thin but intentional)
- **`/reports`** — `PASS` (thin but intentional)
- **`/reports/dna`** — `PASS` (healthy)
- **`/reports/live`** — `PASS` (thin but intentional)
- **`/backtesting/sessions`** — `PASS` (thin but intentional)
- **`/leaderboard`** — `PASS` (healthy)
- **`/admin/inbox`** — `PASS` (thin but intentional)
- **`/admin/inbox?user=88`** — `PASS` (thin but intentional)
- **`/admin/users`** — `PASS` (thin but intentional)
- **`/settings`** — `PASS` (thin but intentional)

## 11. Gating / entitlement status

- **`/surveillance`** — `healthy` (direct route verified)
- **`/reports/dna`** — `gated intentionally` behavior seen (elite gate text observed in sample)
- **premium/elite gated areas** — `needs manual confirmation` (business-rule matrix validation needed)
- **subscription-related flows** — `healthy with risk` (flow works, but intermittent subscription status reliability + 429 observed)

## 12. Console / network issues

- **Recurring `net::ERR_ABORTED`:** observed across API calls and some assets.
- **`429` on subscription status:** observed at least once in hard-check sample.
- **Failed notification fetches:** observed; UI generally degrades gracefully.
- **Platform-connect instability:** high request-failed volume.
- **User impact:** most flows stayed usable; fallback often partial but not catastrophic. Still a production risk under adverse conditions.

## 13. What is definitely working

- Core admin<->user messaging flow (standard path)
- Websocket-degraded messaging fallback path
- Community realtime posting + reload dedupe (`COMM-RT-REM-001`)
- Public site pages (`/courses`, `/explore`, `/contact`, `/terms`, `/privacy`, `/login`)
- Authenticated core data hubs (`/reports`, `/reports/dna`, `/reports/live`, `/trader-deck`, `/aura-analysis`, `/backtesting`, `/leaderboard`)
- Admin operational pages (`/admin`, `/admin/inbox`, `/admin/users`, `/settings`) in baseline flow

## 14. What still needs manual checking

- True financial calculation correctness (P/L, DNA metrics, risk ratios, derived stats)
- Real trading/account data correctness vs source-of-record
- Subscription/payment real-world flow end-to-end (including retries, webhooks, entitlement propagation)
- Entitlement matrix by role/tier/channel/page (especially edge transitions)
- Production load/concurrency behavior and long-session stability
- Messaging/community realtime latency under overlap (target: median<1000ms, p95<3000ms)
- High-concurrency messaging behavior (multi-user simultaneous sends across multiple threads)
- Journal and premium-ai deep functional correctness

## 15. Highest-priority follow-up tasks

1. **API reliability hardening** (subscription status, platform-connect, notifications)
2. **Mathematical/data correctness validation** (manual + oracle-based checks)
3. **Subscription/payment manual QA** (real cards/plans/webhooks)
4. **Entitlement matrix QA** (role x tier x route x channel)
5. **Performance/load testing** (messaging/community concurrency and failover; required to close `QA-RISK-MSG-CONCURRENCY-001`)
