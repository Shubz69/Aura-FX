AURA FX - MySQL Workbench SSL Connection Setup
===============================================

Railway MySQL requires SSL connections. Follow these steps:

STEP 1: CREATE CONNECTION
=========================
1. Open MySQL Workbench
2. Click "+" to create new connection
3. Enter basic details:
   - Connection Name: AURA FX Railway MySQL
   - Hostname: tramway.proxy.rlwy.net
   - Port: 49989
   - Username: root
   - Password: FGcoKdqpUYWNb1nXzdGmBUACzeYDmewb
   - Default Schema: railway

STEP 2: CONFIGURE SSL (CRITICAL!)
==================================
1. In the connection dialog, click on "SSL" tab (at the bottom)
2. Select "Use SSL" checkbox
3. SSL CA File: Leave empty (or use "Require SSL" option)
4. SSL Cert File: Leave empty
5. SSL Key File: Leave empty
6. SSL Cipher: Leave empty
7. SSL Mode: Select "Require" or "Preferred"

ALTERNATIVE: Use "Use SSL" with "Require SSL" option checked

STEP 3: ADVANCED SETTINGS
==========================
1. Click "Advanced" tab
2. Under "Others", add this parameter:
   ssl-mode=REQUIRED
   
   OR in the "Others" text box, add:
   ssl-mode=REQUIRED;ssl-ca=;ssl-cert=;ssl-key=

STEP 4: TEST CONNECTION
========================
1. Click "Test Connection"
2. If it still fails, try these alternatives:

ALTERNATIVE METHOD 1: Use Connection String
===========================================
Instead of individual fields, try using the connection string format:
- In MySQL Workbench, you might need to use the "Connection String" option if available

ALTERNATIVE METHOD 2: Check Railway Service Status
===================================================
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Check if MySQL service is "Online" (green status)
3. Check the "Logs" tab for any connection errors
4. Verify the service is not paused

ALTERNATIVE METHOD 3: Try Internal Hostname
============================================
If public URL doesn't work, Railway might require internal connection:
- Hostname: mysql.railway.internal
- Port: 3306
- Note: This only works from within Railway services, not from your local machine

ALTERNATIVE METHOD 4: Use Command Line
=======================================
Try connecting via command line first to verify credentials:
mysql -h tramway.proxy.rlwy.net -P 49989 -u root -p
(Enter password when prompted)

If command line works but Workbench doesn't, it's an SSL configuration issue.

TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ERRORS:
===============================
1. "Access denied" - Check username/password are correct
2. "Can't connect" - Check hostname and port
3. "SSL required" - Enable SSL in Workbench (see Step 2)
4. "Connection timeout" - Check firewall/network settings

NEXT STEPS IF STILL FAILING:
=============================
1. Check Railway MySQL service logs for connection attempts
2. Verify the MySQL service is running and accessible
3. Try connecting from a different network (in case of firewall issues)
4. Contact Railway support if service appears down
