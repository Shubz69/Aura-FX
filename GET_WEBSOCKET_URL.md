# Get Your WebSocket Service Public URL

## Your Service is Set Up! ✅

I can see your WebSocket service "Aura-FX" is configured with:
- Root Directory: `/websocket-server` ✅
- Branch: `main` ✅
- Status: Online ✅

## Get the Public URL

1. **In Railway, click on your "Aura-FX" service** (the WebSocket one, not MySQL)
2. **Go to "Settings" tab** (you're already there!)
3. **Scroll down to "Networking" section**
4. **Click "Generate Domain"** button (if you haven't already)
5. **Copy the public URL** - it will look like:
   - `https://aura-fx-production.up.railway.app`
   - Or similar format

## Share the URL

Once you have the public URL, share it with me and I'll update the frontend code to use it!

The URL should be visible in the "Networking" section of your service settings.
