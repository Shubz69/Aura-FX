# Find WebSocket Service Public URL on Railway

## Steps to Find Your WebSocket Service URL

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.app
2. **Find Your WebSocket Service**:
   - Look for a service named something like:
     - `aurafx-realtime`
     - `websocket-server`
     - `realtime`
     - Or any service you created for WebSocket
3. **Click on the WebSocket Service** (not the MySQL service)
4. **Go to "Settings" Tab**
5. **Look for "Public Domain" or "Generate Domain"**:
   - If you see "Generate Domain" button, click it
   - The public URL will look like: `your-service-name-production.up.railway.app`
6. **Copy the Public URL** (e.g., `aurafx-websocket-production.up.railway.app`)

## Update Frontend with Your WebSocket URL

Once you have the public URL, I'll update the code. The URL should be in this format:
- `https://your-service-name-production.up.railway.app`

**Please provide me with:**
1. The exact public URL of your WebSocket service from Railway
2. Or tell me the service name and I'll help you find it

## Current Configuration

The frontend is currently set to use:
- `https://aurafx-realtime-production.up.railway.app`

If your Railway service has a different name/URL, I'll update it.
